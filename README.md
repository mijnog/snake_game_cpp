# snake_game_cpp

Just me messing around with chatgpt slowly iterating and making the game better. I've saved each chatGPT iteration that didn't make the game break completely in a seperate file for interest's sake.

To compile:

    g++ snake.cpp -o snake -lncurses

Or simply:

    make

Make sure ncurses is installed on your system:

    sudo apt install libncurses-dev
